# Read the code aloud

This is an entry in [NaNoGenMo 2017](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017) : this PHP application reads a PHP script, and reads aloud every line. 

Operators are turned into sentences, and many native PHP functions are also turned into natural language. 

PHP version 7.0 and the [AST extension](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast) is needed for this to run.

php php2english.php <file.php> 

Results are in 'out.txt'.

The 'chamilo.wiki.php' file is included to achieve the size of the novel of the NaNoGenMo/2017. It belongs to the [Chamilo project](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms).

This is initial version. May be I'll keep doing something on that.
